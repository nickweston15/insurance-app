This app is a mock cyberinsurance application platform. It is not intended for actual use.

Here I use a full-stack JavaScript tech-stack (React + Node.js/Express) to create an app where companies "apply" for cyberinsurance, and the app asynchronously runs a security risk assessment via webhooks that can flag the applicant's submission if they lack appropriate cybersecurity posture.
