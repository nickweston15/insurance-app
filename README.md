This app is a mock cyberinsurance application platform. It is not intended for actual use.

Here I use a full-stack JavaScript tech-stack (React + Node.js) to create an app where users apply for cyberinsurance, and the app asynchronously runs security risk assessments via webhooks that can flag the applicant as high-risk or potentially fraudulent.
